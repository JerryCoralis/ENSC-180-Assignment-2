Good afternoon Hadi,

I have a question regarding Assignment2 - part1.

We have a number of options to import the .xlsx data into matlab, can you guide me as to which one I should use?
Here is what I have come up with.

- uiimport()
requires the user to manually select the data, so I assume this is not what we want. 

- importdata()
seems to work fine, data is stored in 3 variables numerics, txt, headers. 

- readtable()
the outputted table array most resembles the inputted excel data.

- xlsread()
[num] = xlsread(filename) yields a prepared table, grabbing the numeric and NaN entries. Seems easy to cut out all rows and cols with NaN, and start setting up the plotting functions 


A few of these options seem plausible, can you direct me to which one is the best to use.

Also when we are graded on this, will it be marked against the same excel spreadsheet we were provided? 
I'm asking because I code variables expecting the data to be in a certain order in terms of columns and rows. 

Sorry for the lengthy question, I hope your break is going well,
Jerry
