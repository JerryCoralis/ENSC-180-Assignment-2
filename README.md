- Working on prepping data, first iteration: 
removes all rows that contain only NaN via any(rawArray,2)

!!! vectorization = when you use a matrix operation to reduce a loop
ie) if you wanted to add 1 to each element in an array, it is cheaper to do an matrix operation then to loop through every element

- appened ms to s via datetime or sx10^2+ms. This is our x data points
